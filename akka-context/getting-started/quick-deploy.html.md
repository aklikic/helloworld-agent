# Deploy to akka.io

|  | **New to Akka? Start here:**

Use the [Build your first agent](author-your-first-service.html) guide to get a simple agentic service running locally and interact with it. |
You’ve built and tried the service locally, it’s time to run it on the Akka Agentic Platform without having to change any code.

1. If you have not already done so, [install the Akka CLI](../operations/cli/installation.html).
2. Authenticate the CLI with your Akka account:

```command
akka auth login
```
3. Build a container image of your service:

```command
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```
4. Take note of the container name and tag from the last line in the output, for example:

```command
DOCKER> Tagging image helloworld-agent:1.0-SNAPSHOT-20250630102843 successful!
```
5. Set up secret containing the API key:

```command
akka secret create generic openai-api --literal key=$OPENAI_API_KEY
```
6. Deploy your service, replacing:

  - `container-name` with the container name from the `mvn install` output in the previous step
  - `tag-name` with the tag name from the `mvn install` output in the previous step

```command
akka service deploy helloworld-service helloworld-agent:tag-name --push \
  --secret-env OPENAI_API_KEY=openai-api/key
```
Your service named `helloworld-service` will now begin deploying.
7. Verify the deployment status of your service:

```command
akka service list
```
A service status can be one of the following:

  - **Ready**: All service instances are up-to-date and fully available.
  - **UpdateInProgress**: Service is updating.
  - **Unavailable**: No service instances are available.
  - **PartiallyReady**: Some, but not all, service instances are available.
Approximately one minute after deploying, your service status should become **Ready**.
8. Expose your service to the internet:

```command
akka service expose helloworld-service
```
Should respond with something similar to (the exact address will be unique to your service):

```command
Service 'helloworld-service' was successfully exposed at: spring-tooth-3406.gcp-us-east1.akka.services
```
Congratulations! You have successfully deployed your service. You can now access it using the hostname described in the output of the command above.

## <a href="about:blank#_invoke_your_deployed_service"></a> Invoke your deployed service

You can use [cURL](https://curl.se/) to invoke your service, replacing URL with the hostname from the previous step.

Make an HTTP request to the service:

```command
curl -i -XPOST --location "https://spring-tooth-3406.gcp-us-east1.akka.services[http://localhost:9000]/hello" \
    --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{"user": "alice", "text": "Hello, I am Alice"}'
```

## <a href="about:blank#_explore_the_console"></a> Explore the console

1. Open the <a href="https://console.akka.io/">**Akka Console**</a>.
2. Navigate to the **Project** where the Service is deployed.
3. Click on the **Service** card of the Service. It shows detailed information about the running service.
