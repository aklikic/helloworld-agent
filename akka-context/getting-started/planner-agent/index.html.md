# Build an AI multi-agent planner

|  | **New to Akka? Start here:**

Use the [Build your first agent](../author-your-first-service.html) guide to get a simple agentic service running locally and interact with it. |
This guide starts with creating an agent that suggests real-world activities. We will incorporate more components in separate parts of the guide, and at the end we will have a multi-agent system with dynamic planning and orchestration capabilities.

1. [Activity agent](activity.html) — An Agent (with session memory) that suggests real-world activities using an LLM.
2. [User preferences](preferences.html) — An Entity (long-term memory) to personalize the suggestions.
3. [Weather agent](weather.html) — A weather forecasting Agent that uses an external service as an agent tool.
4. [Orchestrate the agents](team.html) — A Workflow that coordinates long-running calls across the agents.
5. [List by user](list.html) — A View that creates a read-only projection (i.e. a query) of all activity suggestions for a user.
6. [Dynamic orchestration](dynamic-team.html) — An Agent that creates a dynamic plan using an LLM, and a Workflow that executes the plan.
7. [Evaluation on changes](eval.html) — A Consumer that streams user preference changes to trigger an Agent.
