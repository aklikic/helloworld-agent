# Build a shopping cart

|  | **New to Akka? Start here:**

Use the [Build your first agent](../author-your-first-service.html) guide to get a simple agentic service running locally and interact with it. |
This guide introduces the basics of building a shopping cart service using Akka. In the first part, you will build and deploy a simple event-sourced service with an HTTP API. In the second part, you will extend the model, introduce views, and add user authentication.

1. [A simple shopping cart service](build-and-deploy-shopping-cart.html) — A simple HTTP-based shopping cart backed by an event-sourced entity.
2. [Authenticated user-specific lookup](addview.html) — Add a user-specific cart view, refactor the model, and secure the endpoint with JWT authentication.
