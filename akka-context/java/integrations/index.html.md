# Integrations

Akka enables seamless communication between services, components and external systems. The following integration options are available:

- [Component and Service Calls](../component-and-service-calls.html): Directly invoke other services or components within your application.
- [Message Brokers](../message-brokers.html): Publish to and subscribe to events from external message brokers like Kafka or Pulsar.
- [Streaming](../streaming.html): Built-in support for processing and reacting to streams of data.
- [Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)](../rag.html): Enrich the context to an AI model with relevant content, using semantic search on a vector database, or retrieve structured information from entities and views.
