# Distributed systems

Modern distributed systems—whether agentic AI, microservices applications, or edge computing—demand more than just scalable infrastructure. They require systems that are resilient under stress, responsive under load, elastic with demand, and maintainable at scale. Akka is built from the ground up on proven battle-tested principles of distributed computing, reflecting more than a decade-long commitment to applying architectural discipline to the nondeterminism and chaos of concurrency, distribution, and failure.

|  | Akka’s approach is to make the *inherent complexity* of the problem space—the *nondeterminism* of distributed systems and *stochastic* nature of LLMs—first-class in the programming model, allowing it to be managed and kept under control as the system grows over time. |
This is to avoid leaky abstractions that force you to pay the price later (when moving to production) through unbounded and undefined compounded *accidental complexity*. Accidental complexity can, if not kept under control, add exponential cost in terms of maintainability, understandability, extensibility, and overall infrastructure costs.

## <a href="about:blank#_rooted_in_the_reactive_manifesto_and_the_reactive_principles"></a> Rooted in the Reactive Manifesto and the Reactive Principles

At the core of Akka’s design philosophy is the [Reactive Manifesto](https://reactivemanifesto.org/) and the [Reactive Principles](https://www.reactiveprinciples.org/).

The **Reactive Manifesto** defines the four fundamental high-level traits of a well-architected distributed system:

| Trait | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Responsive | The system responds in a timely manner. Responsiveness is the cornerstone of usability and utility, and it underpins other aspects of the system. |
| Resilient | The system stays responsive in the face of failure. This applies not only to highly-available, mission-critical systems—but also to every user-facing system where failure impacts user experience. |
| Elastic | The system stays responsive under varying workload. It can scale up or down as needed without compromising responsiveness. |
| Message-Driven | The system relies on asynchronous message passing to establish a boundary between components. This ensures loose coupling, isolation, and location transparency. |
The **Reactive Principles** distils these four traits into a set of foundational guiding principles for great distributed systems design:

| Principle | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Stay Responsive | Ensure the system always responds in a timely and consistent manner to promote user confidence and system predictability. |
| Accept Uncertainty | Embrace the inherent nondeterminism in distributed systems and build designs that can tolerate and adapt to it. |
| Embrace Failure | Design for failure as a first-class concern by building fault tolerance and recovery into the architecture. |
| Decentralize | Distribute responsibility across components and teams to avoid single points of failure or contention. |
| Isolate State | Ensure state is encapsulated and protected from concurrent access to avoid race conditions and promote scalability. |
| Communicate via Messages | Use asynchronous message passing to decouple components, enabling better concurrency, fault tolerance, and scalability. |
Akka embodies these principles as concrete implementation guidelines. Every feature reinforces predictable, manageable, and observable behavior at scale. This applies to durable in-memory event-sourced persistence, streaming view projections, multi-region/multi-cloud replication, CRDT-based data coordination, cluster membership, and sharding.

The foundation of Akka is detailed in the [O’Reilly Technical Guide: Principles and Patterns for Distributed Application Architecture](https://content.akka.io/guide/principles-and-patterns-for-distributed-application-architecture) (authored by Akka CTO and founder Jonas Bonér). Psst - get a free copy by clicking the link! This guide outlines architectural patterns that are essential for building robust systems, including how to leverage:

- Event sourcing and CQRS for reliable state management and auditability.
- Event-driven communication, coordination, and integration.
- Consistency boundaries with command and side-effect separation to maintain deterministic behavior under concurrency, balancing strong and eventual consistency.
- Location transparency for dynamic system topology,  fault tolerance, and elastic scalability.
- Autonomous stateful agents/services with temporal guarantees are crucial for maintaining consistency across systems of distributed agents.
- Backpressure and flow control, ensuring that communication channels between services or agents never become bottlenecks or cause failure due to data overload.
- Failure signaling and supervision, allowing systems to self-heal and degrade gracefully.
- Automatic and transparent self-replication of agents and services for failover, redundancy, and scale.
These constructs are operationalized in Akka’s runtime through [Agents](../java/agents.html), [Entities](../java/event-sourced-entities.html), [Views](../java/views.html), [Endpoints](../java/http-endpoints.html), [Workflows](../java/workflows.html), and [Consumers](../java/consuming-producing.html) backed by actors, event-sourced persistence, multi-region replication, durable streaming real-time projections, and sharded clusters—all battle-tested in production systems across industries for over a decade, providing a tuned and proven runtime for enterprise-grade services.

## <a href="about:blank#_designed_for_multi_agent_ai"></a> Designed for multi-agent AI

Multi-agent AI systems combine the inherent *nondeterminism* of distributed systems with the *stochastic* behavior of AI models, particularly those based on large language models (LLMs). This dual complexity means traditional software design, development, and operations approaches are insufficient.

The demands of multi-agent AI systems—which involve large numbers of autonomous, stateful, and often long-lived agents—require managing complexity around orchestration, streaming, memory, and temporal behaviors while being able to reason about the system as a whole and embrace its stochastic and non-deterministic nature. Akka’s approach to multi-agent architectures includes:

- Actor-based isolation and concurrency control for stateful [Agents](../java/agents.html) that must reason and act independently while coordinating with others.
- Asynchronous messaging and streaming decouple computation from communication, allowing for flow control and resilient communication between [Agents](../java/agents.html), critical for latency-sensitive inference or decision-making.
- Operational resilience, with fully replicated stateful [Agents](../java/agents.html) that restart and recover in place.
- Automatic short-term (session) and long-term memory through the [Agent’s](../java/agents.html) built-in durable in-memory storage, allowing replayability through event logs, ensuring agents can recover, reflect, reason, and explain past behavior.
- Dynamic scaling and routing are done through automatic and transparent sharding and cluster management.
- Loose coupling and evolvability, aided by schema-versioned messages and contract-first APIs.
- Multi-region replication based on CRDTs for collaborative knowledge sharing and eventual consistency without global locking.

## <a href="about:blank#_why_it_matters"></a> Why It Matters

Building agentic AI systems—or modern cloud-native microservices—on unstable foundations leads to brittle architectures that fail under real-world conditions. Akka mitigates this risk by enforcing principles and patterns anticipating failure, load, inconsistency, and change.

Whether deploying thousands of autonomous AI agents or orchestrating business-critical microservices, Akka gives you the architectural clarity and operational reliability to build systems that thrive in the real world, not just in theory.
